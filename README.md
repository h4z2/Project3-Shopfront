## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have come to understand javascript to a much higher degree than before I began this project. I have also learnt a lot about the structure and layout of a webpage and how padding, margin, ect
affects the layout.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to code multiple elements in my webpage as well as structure the page
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website came in useful to further my knowledge with CSS and java elements
